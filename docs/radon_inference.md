# Radon inference from daughters

The radon inference stage converts fitted isotope time-series data into an
estimate of the Rn-222 activity inside the detector cell. It consumes the
Po-214 and Po-218 count histograms generated during the decay-rate fitting and
translates them into inferred radon levels, aligned with the original binning.

## What it does

* Converts per-bin counts into isotope activities using the configured
  detection efficiencies.
* Applies optional transport and retention efficiency corrections to obtain the
  inferred Rn-222 activity inside the cell.
* Combines multiple isotopes via configurable weights and records the derived
  series in the analysis summary for downstream reporting.
* Divides the inferred activity by an external ambient radon monitor to compute
  an equivalent sampled volume and its cumulative integral.

## Why it matters

The derived series bridges the gap between Po-214/Po-218 counts and the
ambient radon concentration. It highlights how well the monitor keeps up with
the mine environment and surfaces inconsistent assumptions (for example,
incorrect transport or retention efficiencies) that can lead to inflated
volumes. Without this conversion the Po-214 counts are difficult to interpret
in operational units.

## Configuration

Configure the stage in `config.yaml` under `radon_inference`:

```yaml
radon_inference:
  enabled: true
  source_isotopes: ["Po214", "Po218"]
  source_weights:
    Po214: 0.7
    Po218: 0.3
  detection_efficiency:
    Po214: 0.12
    Po218: 0.10
  transport_efficiency: 1.0
  retention_efficiency: 1.0
  chain_correction: none
  external_rn:
    mode: constant
    constant_bq_per_m3: 80.0
```

Set `mode: file` inside `external_rn` to point at a CSV with `timestamp` and
`rn_bq_per_m3` columns. Missing samples fall back to the optional
`constant_bq_per_m3` value after interpolation.

## Limitations

* When the chosen isotope is not in secular equilibrium with Rn-222 the
  inferred activity will lag the true radon level.
* Extremely small external radon concentrations produce unrealistically large
  equivalent volumesâ€”double check the reference monitor calibration in that
  case.
* Transport and retention efficiencies default to 1.0. If they are unknown the
  reported activity represents a lower bound.
