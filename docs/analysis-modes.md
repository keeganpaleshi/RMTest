# Experimental analysis modes

These opt-in options explore new models while keeping defaults unchanged.

- **background_model** `loglin_unit`: log-linear shape normalized to unit area for smooth backgrounds.
- **likelihood** `extended`: extended unbinned likelihood that incorporates the observed event count.

Enable them only when evaluating advanced background or statistical treatments.
